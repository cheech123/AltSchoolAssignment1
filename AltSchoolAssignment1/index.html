          Hello, my name is Chizaram Daberechi Chukwu. My Alt School ID is ALT/SOE/023/2060. <br> <br>
          I am 23 years old. I come from a family of 5; the last born and only
          girl with 2 brothers. <br> <br>
          I am from Abia State, Nigeria. I have been to my state only twice, and that was when I was much younger. I would like to go more often, but there are existing circumstances beyond my control (insecurity issues). <br> <br>
          I am a Computer Science student at Baze University, although I am about
          to graduate by God's grace. <br> <br>
          <b> What are some of my hobbies? </b> <br> <br>
          <details>
            <summary> Hobbies <i> -click to expand </i> </summary>  <br>
            I enjoy listening to music, watching shows and anime, reading, playing games.  
          </details> <br> 
          From a very early age, I fell in love with computers. I've always been
          fascinated with how they work, how they "obey commands". <br> <br>
          I've always wanted to learn how to write commands for the computer to accept. <br> <br>
          My brother was the one who put me on to Alt School Africa. I
          looked it up and saw the amazing opportunities that could arise from
          being enrolled in the school. <br> <br>
          I joined Alt School while still enrolled in the university because I
          realize my need for more in-depth knowledge and guidance in programming
          and how to navigate the tech world. <br> <br>
          So far, I have only had pretty basic tech knowledge in the university. <br> <br>
          I think keeping up with different courses and assignments and tests and deadlines have made it quite challenging for me to focus on expanding my knowledge. <br> <br>
          At a point, I felt discouraged and just decided to focus on passing rather than learning. <br> <br>
          I still get imposter syndrome - regular bouts of it; feeling inadequate and unqualified to pursue a career in tech. <br> <br>
          But I am here to see how far I can push myself and grow in my love for technology, as there are so many things I am intrigued by and want to be able to learn how to do. <br> <br>
          I believe that with the right amount of determination and guidance, I can go very far.

      <h3>WHAT DO I HOPE TO ACHIEVE AT ALT SCHOOL?</h3>
      <article>
        <p>
          At the end of my Alt School year, I hope to become proficient in my tech
          skills. I hope to connect with people in different tech spaces, as well. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Generally, I hope I am able to begin the step in my journey to becoming
          a front-end developer and even developing my skills further so as to go
          full-stack.
